## Where's the Live Demo?

Unfortunately, given the way we used the scikit-learn k-nearest neighbors model with a custom distance/weight function (see final report above), we are not able to provide a heroku-based live demo. It might be possible to provide a live demo via a Linode/EC2 node, but that would be cost-prohibitive for us at this time.

## Running locally

Everything has been tested to work on Mac OSX 10.8. To download our project and run the code locally, follow the following procedure:

### Dependencies

#### pipenv

We use [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to help facilitate getting setup on a new machine. There are [a number of ways of installing it](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today), depending on your operating system.

#### MongoDB, Database Backup, and Environment Variables (optional for just running recommendation engine)

The data on Dota 2 matches we collected was stored in a MongoDB database. To extract the data to train new models, you must first [install MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/). Then, [download the backup of our database](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jgflbwyicd56av7/dotabot_db.zip) and [restore it using this tutorial](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/backup-and-restore-tools/).

Also, our data collection script, [dotabot2](data_collection/dotabot2.py), uses a few environment variables for configuration so that these sensitive variables are not stored in the public repository. Therefore, you must initialize the following environment variables:

    export DOTABOT_API_KEY=[steam web api key]
    export DOTABOT_USERNAME=[email username]
    export DOTABOT_PASSWORD=[email password]
    export DOTABOT_HOSTNAME=[email outgoing smtp server]
    export DOTABOT_DB_SERVER=[mongodb server]
    export DOTABOT_DB_NAME=[mongodb database name]

You may find it helpful to add these commands to your bash profile in your home directory so they are automatically executed each time you open a new terminal window.

### Clone the Repository

    git clone git@github.com:kevincon/dotaml.git

### Initialize pipenv

From inside the repository root folder, initialize pipenv by running:

    pipenv install

Next, activate the pipenv by running:

    pipenv shell

You should now see "(dotaml)" as part of your terminal prompt, indicating you are now inside your virtual environment. Note that closing the terminal window deactivates the virtual environment, so you must run `pipenv show` each time you open a new terminal window for development.

### Running the web app

From the root folder of the project, run:

    python app.py
    
This starts the Flask web app, which you can view in a web browser at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

### Running the recommendation engine via the command line

From the root folder of the project, run:

    python engine.py
    
This (by default) uses the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to perform a hard-coded hero recommendation query. See the main function of [engine.py](engine.py) for more details.

## Contributions and Feedback

Feel free to submit a pull request if you are interested in continuing development. Sadly, we will probably not develop the project further for the foreseeable future. You can also contact us via email using the addresses in the final report (see above).
